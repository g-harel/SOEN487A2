# SOEN487 Assignment 2

## Writing a Web Service Tutorial

### Due date: April 27, before midnight

The goal of this assignment is to write a tutorial for a RESTful web service developed using Flask, like in the microservices developed for the project. You can start from one of your project's microservices, or from your assignment 1. This assignment is an __individual__ assignment, but your teammates can proofread your tutorial to improve it, as long as they don't write it for you. There can be some overlap between the different tutorials, but the largest part of the tutorials should be different.

__The format is up to you__: you could use HTML, Markdown, MS Word (exported as a PDF), Jupyter Notebook, etc... You could even make a video tutorial if you want. Think of it as a tutorial you would give a student at the beginning of the class to give them an idea of how to build a web service.

__There is no fixed length__. Since the format is flexible, it is not possible to set requirements on the number of pages or number of words. It should contain enough details to show the process of developing a web service, without going into all the details of the code, especially not all the details of the imported packages. The amount of work needed to write the tutorial should not be larger that the amount of work needed to develop the web service itself.
